            <p>In 2019, the American Alpine Club accepted the mammoth responsibility to host the first-ever World Cup
                Ice
                Climbing Finals competition to be held in the United States. The event, held in downtown Denver, was
                also the first time any such ice climbing competition had been held in a major US metropolitan city.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Using PR as the primary vehicle for promotion, Purple Orange organized a promotional campaign starting
                9-months in advance of the event. In partnership with Visit Denver, Purple Orange led a massive regional
                and national media campaign that included The Associated Press, Outside Magazine, Popular Mechanics,
                Climbing Magazine, Rock + Ice, The Wall Street Journal, SELF, and dozens more. Altogether we brought the
                sport of ice climbing to living rooms and </p>

                competition in world history.
            </p>
            <p class="bottom-text">The Purple Orange team has done outstanding work producing stories both in our
                industry and also
                non-endemic media that we haven’t previously been able to tap into. What really stands out is the time
                they have spent to get to know the Club and our goals. Purple Orange is not just another public
                relations firm, they take the time to fully immerse themselves their clients’ world.
